Moss is a small but hardy plant, and it can easily be mined and picked up by hand or basically any tool/item, although it is fastest with Shears. In Swampland biomes specifically, you will also find pockets or layers of Peat blocks among the Dirt, typically located just beneath the grass layer. You can mine these with any tool, although it is fastest with a Shovel. ",

However, in any other biome it'll soon dry out and turn into Dirt unless you keep it moist. Luckily, Peat obeys the same rules as Farmland, meaning that any Peat blocks within 4 blocks of water stay irrigated regardless of the biome they are in. Unlike Farmland however, Peat blocks won't be damaged if you jump on them.",
